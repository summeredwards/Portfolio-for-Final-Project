				This project, "API Weather Display", was created using Python code. The program uses a weather API database to display a summary of the weather forecast. The text describes the forecast, and the circles on the right represent the temperature. The size and color of the circles correspond to the temperature. Lighter and cooler colors mean the temperatures are colder. The darker and warmer colors mean the temperatures are warmer. For example, if you see blue, that represents cold temperatures; however, a darker blue will be slighly warmer than a lighter blue. Additionally, at the bottom of the screen, either a sun or moon will be printed depending on the time of day. Click on the image to view my code.

				The goal of this project was described as follows: <br><br>
				"Suppose that the emergency room of a hospital sees a sudden and drastic increase in patients presenting with a particular set of symptoms. Doctors determine the cause to be bacterial, but without knowing the specific species involved they are unable to treat patients effectively. One way of identifying the cause is to obtain a DNA sample and compare it against known bacterial genomes. With a set of similarity scores, doctors can make more informed decisions regarding treatment, prevention, and tracking of the disease." <br><br>
				When run, my program displays a menu which has the following options: <br>
				1. Calculate Similary Score <br>
				2. Find the Best Similarity Score <br>
				3. Analyze the Genome Sequences <br>
				4. Quit <br>
				The menu runs on a loop, continually offering the user four options until they choose quit. Depending on each option, the program will ask for genomes and sequence inputs, and calculate the appropriate answer. Click on the image to view my code.

				The guidelines to this project was to develop an original game using the game-making platform GB Studio and the Design Thinking process. The game theme was given using a random theme generator; mine ended up being "Sleepy Danger". My final game idea is as follows: "In the game, the player will be dreaming nightmares. To reach a good dream, the player will have to complete the nightmare obstacles." The project required us to utilize paper and digital prototyping, along with user testing. These steps were necessary for the Design Thinking process. After completing the necessary requirements, my game was uploaded to itch.io. To play, click on the image.

				"The objective of the design project was to reverse engineer an appliance and transform a minimum of three parts into a children’s toy. The toy must display relevance to the target age group, adhere to safety guidelines, and prove thorough functionality with testing. The team was also limited to a budget of three-hundred seventy-five dollars. Our group chose to reverse engineer a Hoover Windtunnel Rewind: T Series vacuum found at Goodwill. The team decided to harness the power of the motor and create air flow, transforming critical components into an Elefriend game; largely inspired by the early ‘90s game Elefun <br><br>

				The critical components from the original vacuum are the extension cord coil, original housing/tubing, and the motor. The Elefriend consists of an elephant body which houses electrical and mechanical components that produce air flow and a chamber in the elephant’s head which can be loaded with toy components (ex./ butterflies). <br><br>

				​Once loaded with butterflies a player presses the “START” button. The Elefriend ejects powerful air flow which propels butterflies up and out of the elephant trunk, so players can catch them in nets. The team created CAD to illustrate and manufacture the design. Knowledge of fluid dynamics and seals was critical to the evolution of the design. The team also used cutters, 3D printers, electrical circuitry, and resources in the manufacturing center to bring the design to life. To further the design, the team would implement more user customization to the game. Greater manipulation of the intervals for which the Elefriend will turn on and off will create more variety in the game play, changing objectives and making the toy more interactive." <br><br>

				For this project, my team had to create a "name plate" for our team name, which was "Friends". The guidelines required us to have a laser-cut piece, a 3-D printed piece, and two electrical components. For the front of our plate, I designed and laser-cut our design onto a piece of wood. I then painted it to make it look more realistic. Our group then put together an Arduino circuit to light up LEDs, and 3-D printed a support to prop up the plate. We also placed magnets to the back so it could stick to magnetic surfaces. For the second electrical component, we added a button to turn on and off the lights.
